## A simulation of a virtual machine using generational tracing garbage collection.


### A high level overview of GC
In computer science, garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage collector, or just collector, attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program.
